✅ Very good — let’s be precise about where test-generate-config.sh should live.

⸻

📦 Best Place to Put test-generate-config.sh

Put it right next to your scripts/ folder inside packages/newt/,
because it’s a developer helper script, not part of your production app.

Example structure:

packages/
└── newt/
    ├── scripts/
    │   └── generate-config.js
    ├── test-generate-config.sh    <-- ⬅️ goes here
    ├── public/
    ├── src/
    ├── package.json
    ├── vite.config.ts

✅ NOT inside scripts/, because scripts/ is for app-related automation (Node.js scripts).
✅ Keep test-generate-config.sh at the root of the newt/ package — easy for developers to find.

⸻

🛡 Why Put It Here?

Reason	Why
Developer convenience	Easy for you and future devs to run
Clean separation	Keeps Node.js scripts separate from bash scripts
No clutter inside app source (src/) or scripts/ folder	
Standard practice	Dev helper scripts usually live next to the package they help build

🧠 How to Run It (after you place it)

After saving it inside packages/newt/:

cd packages/newt/
chmod +x test-generate-config.sh    # (only once)
./test-generate-config.sh

✅ Done — environment vars set, config.js generated.

📝 Optional Mini README.md for packages/newt/

If you want, you can add a tiny README inside packages/newt/ to explain it:

packages/newt/README.md (append this at the bottom):

## Development Helper Scripts

- **test-generate-config.sh** — Sets local environment variables and runs the `generate-config` script to simulate runtime configuration locally.
  - Usage:
    ```bash
    ./test-generate-config.sh
    ```

- Ensures correct generation of `public/config.js` for local testing without needing to manually export environment variables.

✅ Tiny, clean, documented.

⸻

🎯 TL;DR

Put test-generate-config.sh inside packages/newt/, next to scripts/.
Keep scripts/ for Node.js automation (like generate-config.js).

Would you also like me to show you a slightly enhanced version of the bash script that supports an optional “env switch” later (dev, prod, qa)? 🚀 (Tiny bonus, super useful if you expect multiple environments.)
